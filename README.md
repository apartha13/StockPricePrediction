# Stock Price Prediction w/ LSTM

This project builds a time-series prediction model in PyTorch to forecast stock prices using LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks). It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation within Jupyter Lab.

**Workflow**
1. Data Collection
   - Pulls stock data (ex. Apple = APPL) from Yahoo Finance via ```yfinance```
